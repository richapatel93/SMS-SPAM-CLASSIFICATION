# SMS Spam Classification using Machine Learning

 
#-**Project Overview:**

This project is a binary classification task aimed at identifying whether an SMS message is spam or ham (legitimate). The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle, containing 5,574 messages labeled as either spam or ham.

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to build an effective spam classifier. The goal is to develop, evaluate, and compare different models for SMS spam detection.

#**Key Objectives**
-Understand text classification using NLP and machine learning.
-Apply data preprocessing techniques for text-based datasets.
-Train multiple classification models and compare performance.
-Learn model evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
-Handle class imbalance issues and improve model performance.

#**Dataset Details**

-Source: Kaggle - SMS Spam Collection Dataset
-Total Messages: 5,574

-Columns:

  -v1: Label ("ham" for legitimate messages, "spam" for spam messages)

  -v2: Raw text of the SMS message

-Data Imbalance: The dataset contains more ham messages than spam, which requires handling class imbalance.
